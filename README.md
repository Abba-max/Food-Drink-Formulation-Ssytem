## Food-Drink-Formulation-Ssytem
  This project is a digital solution designed for a private firm specializing in food and drink menu conception. The primary goal is to digitalize, manage, and secure the company's proprietary formulation findings through a user-friendly application.



##  Key Features & Functionalities

The application provides comprehensive tools for managing complex food and drink formulations, focusing on security, flexibility, and detailed record-keeping.

Formulation Management:
    Add New Formulations: Ability to input complete data sets for new food/drink items.
    Consult/Search: Retrieve existing formulations based on various criteria, including ingredients, product name, creation date, or author.
Data Security & Access Control:
    Secure Formulations: Implement encryption for all files to protect sensitive intellectual property.
    Access Rights: Manage user permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can view or modify formulations.
Quality & Compliance:
    Veto Setting: Functionality to officially veto a formulation, marking it as unsuitable or non-compliant.
    Issue Reporting: Allow users to report or comment on formulation issues (e.g., taste, stability, side effects).



##  Core Data Structure Elements

Each digital record represents a complete food/drink formulation and contains the following critical information, often calculated for a one-kilogram unit:

Ingredients List: Name, quantity (weight, volume, fraction), and the ability to be modified to generate new variants.
Operational Details:
    Lab Operating Conditions: Variables like temperature,pressure, moisture, vibration, and time during preparation.
    Preparation Protocol: Step-by-step textual description and time-evolution of environmental factors/ingredients.
Consumer & Market Data:
    Consumer Profile: Target specifications (age range, localization, other specifications).
    Consumer Feedback: Detailed records of like, dislike, and comments.
    Side Effects: Profiles of exposed consumers, observed symptoms, and suggested remedies.
    Positive Impacts: Specific information on positive effects observed in consumers.
    Average Price: Estimated average price per kilogram food.
Logistics & Compliance:
    Consumption Condition: Recommended serving conditions (temperature, milieu).
    Conservation Condition: Storage specifications (temperature, moisture/humidity, container).
    Standards Respected: A list of existing quality or regulatory standards adhered to.
    Trademark Information: Registration details (date, authority, number).
    Authors: List of contributors (name, address).

##  Project Goal

To provide the firm with a secure, centralized, and flexible platform for managing their core intellectual property (food and drink formulations), facilitating both daily operations and future variant development.
